since i need to have a list and a detailed view. I made a section for each and gave them an id and the class page.

I made my beers as en array of objects, each beer has a name, image and contry.
then to append them I made a loop through the beers array and i give each object an index
then i append the using backtick sting. in here make a container and asing it a class which has the index add to it.

this allows me to tie a listed beer to the rigth detailed view page.

to allow the user to add a new beer, i made som inputs fileds, which i the pull the data form. and then i adde it to an opject and then phus it the beers arry as an object.
